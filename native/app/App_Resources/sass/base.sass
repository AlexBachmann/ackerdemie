 * to get a sense of the variables you can edit
 *
 * Of course you can also add your own variable definitions here
 *
 * ATTENTION: Do NOT add any SASS declarations that compile to actual
 * CSS in this file, since this base.sass file will be imported in 
 * various Angular components. Only define variables here.
